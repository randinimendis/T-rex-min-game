This is a basic implementation of a T-Rex game where the player can control the T-Rex to jump over obstacles. The T-Rex jumps when the spacebar is pressed. The obstacles move from right to left, and the player gains points when successfully jumping over an obstacle. The score is displayed on the top-right corner of the screen.
